# KeyboardVisualizer-Installer

The Project KeyboardVisualizer https://github.com/CalcProgrammer1/KeyboardVisualizer is for me relevant because i have a Linux computer and a Razer Keyboard and wanted to use the Audio Visualizer. I wanted to install it and found this official alternative so I made a comfortable install possibility.

## The Installer package way.

Get the .deb package from:

https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/KeyboardVisualizer-Installer/releases/

Go to your file manager and open it with double click

## The shell script way.

## The terminal .deb package way.

If you want the KeyboardVisualizer project wich is for Razer Devices you have to do the following step:
```
wget https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/KeyboardVisualizer-Installer/raw/master/KeyboardVisualizer.deb
```
and them this
```
sudo dpkg -i KeyboardVisualizer.deb
```
