# KeyboardVisualizer-Installer

The Project KeyboardVisualizer https://github.com/CalcProgrammer1/KeyboardVisualizer is for me relevant because i have a Linux computer and a Razer Keyboard and wanted to use the Audio Visualizer. I wanted to install it and found this official alternative so I made a comfortable install possibility. I recommend the shell script way because he build itself the project and is more up-to-date when i forgot to update the .deb package, but he uses more computing power.

## The .deb package way.

Get the .deb package from:

https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/KeyboardVisualizer-Installer/releases/

Go to your file manager and open it with double click

## The shell script way.

Open the terminal and paste the following and press enter:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexProgrammerDE/KeyboardVisualizer-Installer/master/install.sh
```
After this command paste:
```
sudo bash install.sh
```
And press enter
## The terminal .deb package way.

Open the terminal and then paste this and press enter:
```
wget https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/KeyboardVisualizer-Installer/raw/master/KeyboardVisualizer.deb
```
And them this:
```
sudo dpkg -i KeyboardVisualizer.deb
```
